This repository contains the execution component of a Monad node. It is responsible for processing transactions, executing new blocks, and keeping track of the blockchain state. The codebase includes Category Labsâ€™ custom Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation, its database layer, and transaction scheduling logic. The consensus component is located in a separate repository called monad-bft.
To build the source code, you need both self-managed and system-managed dependencies. Most third-party libraries are included as git submodules and are built automatically, but you must first run git submodule update --init --recursive after checking out the repository. Some additional dependencies must be installed from the system package manager, and a complete list can be found in docker/release.Dockerfile. The primary development environment is Ubuntu.
The minimum tool requirements are gcc-15 or clang-19 as a compiler, CMake version 3.27 or newer, and the libstdc++ standard library. Execution also requires a modern CPU that supports the x86-64-v3 instruction set, starting from Intel Haswell or newer. For compatibility, the build process uses the -march=haswell flag, although you can use -march=native if compiling only for your own machine.
To compile, change into the root of the repository and run:
CC=gcc-15 CXX=g++-15 CFLAGS="-march=haswell" CXXFLAGS="-march=haswell" ASMFLAGS="-march=haswell" ./scripts/configure.sh && ./scripts/build.sh
This will generate a build system, compile everything, and produce the execution daemon binary located at build/cmd/monad. This binary provides execution services for the Monad blockchain, with Monad-specific EVM extensions such as staking, and can also replay the history of other EVM-compatible chains as a way to test and verify correctness. You can run the full test suite in parallel with CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL=$(nproc) ctest.
For more details on how execution and consensus work together and where to find different parts of the source code, see the execution developer overview.
